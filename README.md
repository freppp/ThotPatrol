ThotPatrol AntiCheat
probably the worst thing i ever made LOL 

i plan to recode this fully in the future, open-sourced, perhaps even a youtube tutorial or a commnunity project.
if you're a beginner in anti-cheats and want to just try making checks, then this is a good place to start with just
understanding concepts of the game. 

fortunately I have learned much more since I made this (hard to believe i know), I am fully aware that this is spaghetti code 
so laugh at me all you want
